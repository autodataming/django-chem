The project consists in a specialization/extension of the Django ORM which is intended to support the development of cheminformatics applications.

The existing code is a quick adaptation of some classes from the Django GIS extension and mainly represents a proof-of-concept. Supported backends are currently PostgreSQL (via RDKit's own extension) and - to a lesser extent - SQLite (via ChemicaLite). Only a limited range of the desired functionality is currently implemented. The available API supports the storage of a molecular structures and structural searches (exact and substructure). 

Draft documentation is available from the 'docs' subdirectory or online
