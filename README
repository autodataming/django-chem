The goal of this project consists in extending the Django ORM to support
the development of cheminformatics applications.

The existing code is a quick adaptation of some classes from the Django GIS
extension and basically represents a proof-of-concept; only a very limited 
range of the desired functionalities is therefore available (and for a 
single database backend, the PostgreSQL rdbms with the RDKit cartridge).
